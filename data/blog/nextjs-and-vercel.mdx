The blog is written in Next.JS using the Tailwind Next.js starter repo at https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog. Site gets a near perfect Lighthouse score with no effort.

It was remarkably easy to setup and deploy to Vercel (https://vercel.com). The custom domain setup including SSL was also very straightforward. Whole thing took 30 minutes starting
from scratch with no experience of Vercel. Also doesn't cost anything to get started with a site containing custom domains and SSL.

CD is setup automatically (and I mean automatically) from Github and triggered when you push commits to master.

For anyone with a even a basic knowledge of React and static sites this is a better option all round than Wordpress or even a more modern platform like Ghost.
